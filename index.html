Momentum is a word that we hear used colloquially in everyday life. We are often told that sports teams and political 
candidates have "a lot of momentum". In this context, the speaker usually means to imply that the team or candidate 
has had a lot of recent success and that it would be difficult for an opponent to change their trajectory. This is 
also the essence of the meaning in physics, though in physics we need to be much more precise.

Momentum is a measurement of mass in motion: how much mass is in how much motion. It is usually given the symbol p

Impulse is a term that quantifies the overall effect of a force acting over time. It is conventionally given the 
symbol J and expressed in Newton-seconds.

One of the reasons why impulse is important and useful is that in the real world, forces are often not constant. 
Forces due to things like people and engines tend to build up from zero over time and may vary depending on many 
factors. Working out the overall effect of all these forces directly would be quite difficult.

When we calculate impulse, we are multiplying force by time. This is equivalent to finding the area under a force
-time curve. This is useful because the area can just as easily be found for a complicated shape—variable force—
as for a simple rectangle—constant force. It is only the overall net impulse that matters for understanding the 
motion of an object following an impulse.

Valence electrons are electrons that located in the outermost electron shell of an atom. These electrons, being the 
furthest from the nucleus and thus the least tightly held by the atom, are the electrons that participate in bonds 
and reactions. This also means that the number of valence electrons that an element has determines its reactivity, 
electronegativity, and the number of bonds it can form.
